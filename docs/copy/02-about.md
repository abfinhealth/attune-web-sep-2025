### Main Content:
Attune was born from a simple but powerful insight: when credit unions improve the financial health of their members, they also strengthen their own bottom line. It's not a choice between mission and margin—it's a virtuous cycle.

Founded as a business line of the Financial Health Network in 2019, Attune became an independent company on October 1, 2023. Our journey began with a question: how might we help credit unions not just talk about financial health, but truly make it the core of their business model and competitive advantage?

Today, Attune is the industry standard for measuring and implementing financial health strategies that integrate mission and margin for credit unions. We've grown from an idea to a comprehensive solution that transforms how credit unions operate, measure success, and create value.

**Headline:** Our North Star
**Subheadline:** Bring Financial Health to Life

This simple phrase guides everything we do. It's about making financial health more than a concept or a talking point—it's about transforming it into lived reality for credit union members, employees, and communities.

**We believe financial health is:**
- Not just something you offer, but who you are
- Not a charitable initiative, but a business model
- Not a side program, but your competitive advantage
- Not measured in isolation, but connected to performance
